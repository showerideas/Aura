/**
 * Minimal transport interface that abstracts Google Nearby Connections
 * from the wire-protocol logic.
 *
 * Motivations:
 *  1. [NearbyExchangeService] depends directly on [com.google.android.gms.nearby.connection.ConnectionsClient].
 *     That class is a Play Services singleton — impossible to instantiate in JVM unit tests.
 *  2. Extracting send/receive to this interface lets a [FakeNearbyTransport] wire two
 *     in-process "endpoints" together, enabling full wire-protocol JVM tests without
 *     real BLE/Wi-Fi or an Android device.
 *
 * Scope: BYTES payloads only — STREAM payloads (avatar) are out-of-scope for this
 * interface version. Avatar tests belong in instrumented tests where the ParcelFileDescriptor
 * infrastructure is available.
 *
 * This interface intentionally has NO imports from com.google.android.gms or android.*
 * so it is usable in pure-JVM (src/test/) test code.
